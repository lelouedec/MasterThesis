abstract="In the problem of ``human sensing'', videos recorded with wearable cameras give an ``egocentric'' view of the world, capturing details of human activities. In this paper we continue research on visual saliency for such kind of content with the goal of ``active'' objects recognition in egocentric videos. In particular, a geometrical cue is considered in case when the central-bias hypothesis does not hold. The proposed visual saliency models are trained based on eye fixations of observers and incorporated into spatio-temporal saliency models. The proposed models have been compared to state of the art visual saliency models using a metric based on target object recognition performances. The results are promising:they highlight the necessity of a non-centered geometric saliency cue.",

abstract="In this paper, we present a saliency guided image object segment method. We suppose that saliency maps can indicate informative regions, and filter out background in images. To produce perceptual satisfactory salient objects, we use our bio-inspired saliency measure which integrating three factors: dissimilarity, spatial distance and central bias to compute saliency map. Then the saliency map is used as the importance map in the salient object segment method. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous saliency detection method, yielding higher precision (0.7669) and better recall rates (0.825), F-Measure (0.7545), when evaluated using one of the largest publicly available data sets.",

The idea behind the support-vector network was previously implemented for the restricted case where the training data can be separated without errors.

abstract="Expert and intermediate chess players attempted to choose the best move in five chess positions while their eye movements were monitored. Experts were faster and more accurate than intermediates in choosing the best move. Experts made fewer fixations per trial and greater amplitude saccades than did intermediates, but there was no difference in fixation duration across skill groups. Examining the spatial distribution of the first five fixations for each position by skill group revealed that experts produced more fixations on empty squares than did intermediates. When fixating pieces, experts produced a greater proportion of fixations on relevant pieces than did intermediates. It is argued that expert chess players perceptually encode chess configurations, rather than individual pieces, and, consequently, parafoveal or peripheral processing guides their eye movements, producing a pattern of saccadic selectivity by piece saliency.",
